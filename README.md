## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system
- Binance API key and secret (for real trading)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-crypto-trading-bot.git
   cd ai-crypto-trading-bot
   ```

2. **Build Docker Image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t crypto-trading-bot .
   ```

3. **Run the Container**

   **Paper Trading (default):**
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name trading-bot crypto-trading-bot
   ```

   **Real Trading on Binance:**
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name trading-bot \
     -v "$(pwd)/logs":/app/logs \
     -e BINANCE_API_KEY=your_api_key \
     -e BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_api_secret \
     -e USE_BINANCE=1 \
     crypto-trading-bot
   ```

## Configuration

Edit `app/config.py` to customize:
- Trading symbol (default: Bitcoin)
- Trade amount (default: $100)
- Moving average windows
- Schedule interval

## View Logs
Trade logs are saved in `logs/trades.csv` on your host (if using the bind mount), or inside the container otherwise. To copy them out manually:
```bash
docker cp trading-bot:/app/logs/trades.csv ./trades.csv
```

## Security Best Practices
- **Never share your Binance API key or secret.**
- Use API keys with only the permissions you need (e.g., trading only, no withdrawal).
- Delete or regenerate your API key if it is ever exposed.
- Test thoroughly in paper trading mode before enabling real trading.
